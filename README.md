run_analysis.R script reads data from original files for training and test data. It then merges the two data sets, and extracts mean and standard deviation measurements. It also renames columns with relevant variable names, and merges this data with subject and activity columns. Finally it summarizes the data calculating mean of the measurements grouped by subject and activity.
